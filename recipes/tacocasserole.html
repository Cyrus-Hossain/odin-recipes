        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        This “Easy Mexican Casserole” is a hearty, layered dish combining seasoned ground beef simmered in salsa and mixed with chili beans, all built over a base of crushed tortilla chips. It’s topped with sour cream, black olives, green onions, tomatoes, and a generous layer of melted Cheddar cheese.         
        The result is a Tex-Mex comfort meal with crunchy, creamy, and savory elements all in one casserole — versatile, crowd-pleasing, and perfect for weeknight dinners.

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            
            <ol>
                <li> Gather all ingredients. </li>
                <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-baking dish with cooking spray. </li>
                <li> Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 8 to 10 minutes. </li>
                <li> Stir in salsa, reduce heat, and simmer until liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Stir in beans; cook until heated through. </li>
                <li> Spread crushed tortilla chips over the bottom of the baking dish; spoon beef mixture on top. Spread sour cream over beef, then sprinkle olives, green onion, and tomatoes on top. Cover with Cheddar cheese. </li>
                <li> Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbly, about 30 minutes. </li>
                <li> Serve and enjoy! </li>
