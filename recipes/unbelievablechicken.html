        <h2>Description</h2>
        “Unbelievable Chicken” is a grilled-chicken recipe built around a bold, tangy marinade. Chicken breast halves are marinated for several hours in a blend of cider vinegar, coarse mustard, garlic, lime and lemon juice, brown sugar, salt, pepper, and olive oil, then grilled until just cooked through. 
        The marinade delivers a sweet-tangy punch that seeps into the meat, producing juicy, flavorful chicken with a bright, zesty edge. Diners often remark on how the simple ingredients combine to make “everyone who tastes it asks me to share the recipe.” 
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup cider vinegar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons prepared coarse-ground mustard or to taste</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced</li>
            <li>1 lime, juiced</li>
            <li>1/2 lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup brown sugar or to taste</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt or to taste</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>

        </ul>
            
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            
            <ol>
                
                <li>Mix cider vinegar, mustard, garlic, lime juice, lemon juice, brown sugar, salt, and pepper together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Whisk in olive oil. Add chicken and toss evenly to coat. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours to overnight.</li>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat.</li>
                <li>Lightly oil the grill grate. Place chicken on the preheated grill, and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, until juices run clear. Discard any remaining marinade.</li>
